        <b>Personal Update:</b>
        <br>
          I am now working on some open-source research projects, 
          including Large language model for Smart City, 
          and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/reliableAI">Realiable AI</a> (Machine learning for causal discovery).
          If you are interested, welcome to take a look and give me feedback!

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        I am Wei Chen (陈伟), a first year Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://citymind.top/"> CityMind Lab</a> of System Hub affiliated with <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/"> Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>,
        supervised by Prof. <a href="https://yuxuanliang.com/">Yuxuan Liang</a>.
        I am currently working on the research, development, and innovation of spatio-temporal data mining and AI, with a broad range of applications in smart cities.
        Prior to that, I was obtained my Master degree at School of Information Science and Engineering, <a href="http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/main.htm">Ocean University of China</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://yuyanwei.github.io/index-en.html">Yanwei Yu</a>.
        I also worked closely with Principal Researcher <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/juding/">Justin Ding</a> at Microsoft Research Asia.
        I have published some papers in refereed journals (e.g., FGCS) and conferences (e.g. IJCAI). 
        I also served as a sub-reviewer for some prestigious conferences or journals, including KDD, WWW, AAAI, WSDM, and ACM TIST.
        <br>
        <br>
        My research interests include (but are not limited to) machine learning, causal discovery, spatiotemporal data modeling, and intelligent transportation systems.
        I am a strong advocate of open-source and reproducible research.
        To contribute more ideas to the research community, I am trying to make the datasets and codes of our research publicly available on GitHub.
