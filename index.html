        <font color=read>"Really good research means reducing the entropy of the world, not anything else."</font><br>
        
        I've had some boring works in the past, and it really frustrated me.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        I am Wei Chen (陈伟), a first year Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://citymind.top/"> CityMind Lab</a> of System Hub affiliated with <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/"> Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>.
        I am currently working on the research, development, and innovation of AI for Social Good.
        Prior to that, I was obtained my Master degree at School of Information Science and Engineering, <a href="http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/main.htm">Ocean University of China</a>.
        I was also really curious about causal discovery (not everything is AI) when I was working at Microsoft Research Asia.
        <!-- I have published some papers in refereed journals (e.g., TOIS, TKDD) and conferences (e.g. IJCAI, WWW). 
        I also served as a sub-reviewer for some prestigious conferences or journals, including KDD, WWW, CVPR, AAAI, WSDM, and ACM TIST. -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- My research interests include (but are not limited to) machine learning, causal discovery, spatiotemporal data modeling, and intelligent transportation systems.
        I am a strong advocate of open-source and reproducible research.
        To contribute more ideas to the research community, I am trying to make the datasets and codes of our research publicly available on GitHub. -->
